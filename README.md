# ObjectBoundingBoxDetection

This project was part of Flipkart Grid Challenge : Bounding Box Detection

Tools and Frameworks used :
Keras
Libraries used:
pandas
numpy
cv2

Approach:
Stacked multiple convolutional layers to extract features , flattened it and passed it through
a dense layer to get 4 unit output vector

Future Target:
Change evaluation metrics to incorporate accuracy with respect to iou calculations.
